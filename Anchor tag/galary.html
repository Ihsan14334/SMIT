    <caption>SHAHID AFRIDI</caption>
    <p>Sahibzada Mohammad Shahid Khan Afridi (Urdu: شاہد افریدی‎, Pashto: شاهد افریدی; born 1 March 1977) is a Pakistani
        former cricketer and captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.
        An all-rounder, Afridi was a right-handed leg spinner and a right-handed batsman.[7][8]

        Afridi made his ODI debut in 1996 against Kenya. In his second ODI match against Sri Lanka,
        he played his first international innings and broke the record for fastest century in ODI cricket (doing so in
        37 deliveries).
        He made his Test debut against Australia in 1998. Afridi made his T20I debut against England in 2006.
        Afridi was named player of the tournament of the 2007 T20 World Cup. Afridi was player of the match in the final
        of the 2009 T20 World Cup scoring an unbeaten 54 and getting figures of 1/20 off of 4 overs as Pakistan went on
        to win the final.
        Shortly after Pakistan's win at the 2009 World Cup, Pakistan's captain, Younis Khan, announced his retirement
        from T20Is and Afridi was appointed as his successor.
        In 2010, Afridi was appointed Pakistan's ODI captain after the sacking of Mohammad Yousuf.
        Afridi was also appointed Pakistan's Test captain but retired from the format after one match as captain.
        He led the Pakistan team in the 2011 Cricket World Cup where they reached the semi-finals before losing to rival
        India.
        In 2011, Afridi was removed as ODI captain. In 2015, Afridi retired from ODI cricket.
        After Pakistan's group stage elimination from the 2016 T20 World Cup, Afridi stepped down from captaincy.
        He was not selected afterwards and on 19 February 2017, Afridi announced his retirement from international
        cricket.
        He made a brief return to international cricket after being selected to represent and captain the World XI
        against the West Indies in the 2018 Hurricane Relief T20 Challenge charity match. Following the conclusion of
        the match, Afridi announced his retirement from international cricket again on 31 May 2018. He served as the
        interim chief selector of the Pakistan cricket team for Pakistan's series against New Zealand.

        Afridi runs his own charity, the Shahid Afridi Foundation which aims to provide education and healthcare
        facilities. He also teamed up with UNICEF to promote the anti-polio campaign in the country. During the 2019
        Coronavirus pandemic, he was involved in helping people across Balochistan during the lockdown in the country.
        This led to him contracting COVID-19 on 13 June 2020.[9] Afridi was also nominated among the top 20 most
        charitable athletes of 2015.[10]</p>
